<h2>Recurring</h2>
<p> 
function dispenser(a){
    //This function takes an argument a and returns another function that takes a second argument b.
  return function(b){
    //he second function returns yet another function, glass, which takes a third argument g.
    return function glass (g){
      return "You can drink Water"
      //The glass function always returns the string "You can drink Water," regardless of the arguments passed.
    }
  }
};
let dis= dispenser("yes")
//Calling dispenser("yes") returns a new function that expects the next argument, b.
dis now holds a function waiting for b.
let water=dis("cold water")
//Calling dis("cold water") returns another function waiting for the third argument, g.
water now holds a function that expects g
let cup=water("present")
//Calling water("present") returns the string "You can drink Water".
console.log(cup)
So, cup is set to "You can drink Water."
